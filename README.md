## About Me
My name is Kylie Hoar, and I am an undergraduate student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts. I am currently 
pursuing a B.S. in Data Science, and a B.S. in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. I am actively seeking full-time
employment after my graduation in May 2025, and would love to chat! In this repo are some coding projects I have completed during
my undergraduate years.
  
Please feel free to email me at kyliehoar10@gmail.com for any inquiries.

The following projects are included:
1. `ultimate_iron_mike` is a project that I completed in a team of 3 from November - December 2024. We worked to analyze a dataset from `kaggle.com` about UFC fights. Our goal for the project was to create a machine learning model that predicted UFC fight outcomes based on a select set of features about each fighter (height, reach, win streak, etc.). We first cleaned, visualized, and engineered the data to prepare it for machine learning. We then trained the data on a variety of machine learning classification models from `scikit-learn`: Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN, SVM. We selected the optimal model based on the test results (SVM) and then developed a web-based user interface to demonstrate our concept. See `web-app` folder on details for how to run this demonstration.
